# ICP-Pay-Protocol
A standardized Payment QR Code protocol built on the Internet Computer (ICP)
Proposal Framework
1. Background
ICP offers a low-cost, high-speed environment without external infrastructure, making it ideal for building payment protocols.
Payment QR Codes are widely accepted globally, with mature user habits and strong compatibility.
Clear use cases include online e-commerce payments and offline QR-based transactions.

2. Proposal Objectives
To establish a universal Payment QR Code specification that includes:
A standardized format (e.g., transaction amount, target wallet address, memo field, etc.).
Support for multiple payment tokens (e.g., ICP, ckBTC, etc.).
Extensibility to accommodate future tokens or payment methods.
A standard URL protocol for requesting native ICP transfers, ICRC Token transfers, and ICP transactions allows for a better user experience across apps and wallets in the ICP ecosystem.

4. Core Features
QR Code Generation and Parsing Specification
Standardized fields ï¼š
